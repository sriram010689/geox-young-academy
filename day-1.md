Day 1 - Morning
===============

**9. Oct. 9:00 - 12:30**

Goals
-----
[goals]: #goals

From feedback, we got the two main points:

- You would like to cooperate on digital projects.
- Therefore, you would also like to use a common language: Python.

To make it obvious what can be completed by lunch of day 1 and to allow you to
do that before, you can view the [TODO Section][todo].

Tools
-----

The morning of day 1 aims at enabling you to use the following tools:

- Python 3 as Python 2 is will be outdated soon.
  If you can install Python 3.6, this is best.
- [Jupyter][jupyter] as this allows sharing reproducible scientific research
  as interactive Python website.
- The version control system Git to share changes and progress with other
  people online.

Means
-----

This document aims to achieve the [goals][goals] with the following means.
These are tutorials for self-study which should make you familiar with the
technologies used.

### Communication

- [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/KDD-OpenSource-community/geox-young-academy][gitter-badge]][gitter]
  We have a chat in which you can copy and paste links.
  You can also chat privately with other participants.
- If we help each other, we will get more stuff done. If you completed something,
  please look around you if there is someone who could do well with your
  attention (not help).
  There is also a [coaching guide][coaching-guide] which helps develop understanding.

### Python

How to get familiar with Python.
- [Waterloo tutorial][waterloo] -
  This tutorial is available in several languages.
  You can skip sections you are familiar with.
  If includes common mistakes people do with Python and uses different
  approaches to solve tasks.
- [Turtle, webserver, ...][ots] - if you are interested in other, interactive
  ways of learning Python, you can try out the Python for Beginners workshop
  by the OpenTechSchool.
  It might be best to do it with somebody else together as you may get stuck.

### Jupyter and Anaconda

To install Jupyter, we [install Anaconda][anaconda].
It brings a lot of scientific computation tools with it which would take a long
time to install one-by-one own.

### Git
[git]: #git

You can install Git as stated by [Github][install-git].

Here are some tutorials you may enjoy after you installed Git:

- [Try Git][try-git]
- [Git Guide][git-guide]

It is OK if you choose one of those. Having a diverse experience in the group,
we can learn more with each other.

## TODO
[todo]: #todo

These are the things which to complete help reach the [goals][goals].
They are ordered by importance and estimated by mean duration.

You can view them [here][todo-template].
Additionally, we ask you:

- Bring your own data. If you like to work on a project, have it with you.

## Participants

There people participate in the workshop:

- Nicco Kunzmann, Github: @niccokunzmann
